1. Hash Table class partially functional several bugs causing unknown crashes
2. Big O requirements were satisified for all classes that work. The implementation
   in hashtable should also satisfy the requirements but they do not always work

set(): checked for key if it did exist it would update the association with the new
       value
       if hashtable was not at capacity, new association would be mapped between
       key and value and number of entries incremented
       if not a permanent value this association would be marked as the youngest
       association making it the
       tail node of the ordered list
       if it was the oldest the after node would become the oldest association
touch(): checked to see if the key existed in the table
         if it did and was non permanent it was set as the youngest node and the 
         the associations after and before would link to complete the order link
         while the youngest became the after node
discard(): simply discarded oldest node marked by pointed by a tail pointer m_old
           on the link list of order and the before node became the oldest node
